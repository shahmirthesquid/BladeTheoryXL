### Camera
Originally had a 700 TVL Spektrum camera. Wow this was such a bad camera. Terrible FOV and no OSD support.
Replacing with a CADDX Ratel 2. Currently waiting for it to arrive.

### Video Transmitter (VTX) 
200mw VTX is actually quite nice. Range is very good for 200mw. Unfortunately you have to physically turn on the VTX button every flight. 
I am replacing this with AKK Long range 3W VTX. Currently waiting for it to arrive.

Replaced with SpeedyBee ELRS Nano reciever from amazon

### ESC
Stock power delivery board, and 30A BLHeli ESCS running OneShot125 protocol. ESCs are kinda bad, but after a custom tune they were alright. They didn't seem to have the precision of more modern ESCS using DSHOT protocol. I have the parts to replace these, but I'd like to ride these until they die so that I dont' make ewaste.

### Motors
